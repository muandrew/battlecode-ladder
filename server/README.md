## GraphQL
* check out ChromeiQL or other out of the box solutions for an easy way to test the GraphQL endpoint.

## Dependencies
* java 8
* golang 1.8
* unzip

**note:** The version numbers are the ones I'm using, and does not mean the exact version is required.

## Warnings
* Running an initial match is pretty ram heavy, I tried with a 512mb box and the compilation failed. This could
  also be because I'm using Redis.
